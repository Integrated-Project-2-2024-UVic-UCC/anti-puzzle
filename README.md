# Anti puzzle
## Project Introduction

Anti-Puzzle was born from the idea of making a robot that allows the elderly to exercise and have fun. In this way it is intended to help them to preserve their vision and decision making. The aim of this game is to fit a piece into a hole as vertically as possible, otherwise the robot will escape.
